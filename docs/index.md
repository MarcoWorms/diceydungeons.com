Hello! Welcome to the WIP site for Dicey Dungeons!

The latest playable version is <a href="https://terrycavanaghgames.com/dice/">the 7drl build, from the 22nd of March.</a>

### Roadmap

Here's the rough plan for the next few updates. I'm aiming to do these roughly once a week!

#### Milestone 2

This milestone will focus on tidying the game up after the 7drl jam build. This partially means a basic graphical overhaul - no necessarily final graphics, but something more that the placeholder stuff there right now. 

But I want to do a design pass, and fix up most of the big design flaws. In particular:
   - Enemies that shield a lot aren't fun. Gonna scrap the Squire, redesign the knight, and generally make enemy shielding rarer.
   - I want to rethink the Focus and Rage skills, and see if I can find a system that works better.
   - Single use items don't work. Rethink these.
   - Tweaks to existing equipment that's not quite working, like Poison Sling.
   - Add some new enemies, and new equipment. Create a greater range of viable stragies that you can aim for.
   - Redesign the Yeti.
   
I'd also like to have a go at some new systems, and see how they feel. Interested in trying:
  - Shops, currency, money mechanics.
  - Weapon upgrading systems.
  - A Limit break system.
  - A Mana system.
  - A "Flee" mechanic.

Not sure how much of this I'll get done, but I'm aiming to do at least some of it by *Friday the 23rd of March*, and have a new build up then.

#### Milestone 3

For this milestone, I want to focus on getting a second class playable - the *Thief*.

#### Future Milestones

At the moment, I'm not planning more than two weeks ahead. Let's see where this thing goes!
