Hello! I made a game for this year's 7 Day Roguelike. It's called <a href="https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2018/rate/234586">Dicey Dungeons</a> and you can <a href="https://terrycavanaghgames.com/dice/">go play it right now</a>!

Only... well, it's a bit broken. So much so that I freaked out a little bit about sharing it publicly at first. These days, I usually keep pretty quiet about prototypes - it's been a long time since I shared something this rough.

The thing is, <i>I really like this game</i>. I think with a bit more work, this currently broken idea of a game could be really, really great. So I'm going to spend a little more time on it. Give it another two weeks. See where it goes.

This does means putting State Machine on hold for a few weeks, but I think that's probably a good thing. Ruari and I have been working solidly on that for close to two and a half years, and I think we're overdue a little creative break. (Ruari's actually working on <a href="https://twitter.com/randomnine/status/965324342996471808">a very cool sideproject of his own</a> that he should have some news about soon...)

I plan to be a bit more open about the development of this, <a href="https://discord.gg/z7pCdCP">so I've set up a discord?</a> Yeah, I dunno, I just thought I'd try it! DICE PLANET.
